susde are locked in a Vault on mainnet, that broadcasts a cross-chain message to the USDb contract on Sei minting an equal amount of tokens to the user. Staked USDb are rebalanced daily, in positive with further minting if profits are accrued, in negative (burning) if losses were registered. The ERC4626 vault share standard makes it trivial to implement such features.
